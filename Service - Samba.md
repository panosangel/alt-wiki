## Service - Samba

## Install Samba
```bash
sudo apt-get install samba
```

## Create a public folder to share
Next, create the public folder where everyone should have access to as is defined in the Samba configuration.
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/storage/public
```
Set the permissions so that everyone can read and write to it.
```bash
sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/storage/public
sudo chmod -R 0775 /mnt/storage/public
```

## Samba group & users
Create a user group for the private group shares:
```bash
sudo addgroup <common-group>
```
Then add an **existing system user** to the group by running the commands below:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG <common-group> <username>
```
Finally, all users who need to access a protected samba share will need to type a password. Samba doesn't use the system account password, so we need to set up a Samba password for our user account:
```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a <username>
```
Edit an **existing samba user's** password with:
```bash
sudo smbpasswd <username>
```
Finally, list all samba users:
```bash
sudo pdbedit -L -v
```

## Configure a group folder to share
If not done already (_See the Users guide for more!_): 
- Create the a common group folder.
- Set ownership of the folder to `root:common`
- Set the permissions to `0770` so that only group `common` members can read and write to it.

## Samba private shares
If not done already (_See the Users guide for more!_): 
- Create private user's (i.e jim) folder.
- Set ownership of the folder to `jim:jim`
- Set the permissions to `0770` so that only user `jim` user can read and write to it.

## Configure Samba
Make a backup copy of the configuration file and edit it:
```bash
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.ORIGINAL
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Configuration example:
```
[global]
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  server string = %h has never left home!
  interfaces = lo enp3s0
  bind interfaces only = yes

  log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
  max log size = 1000

  server role = standalone server
  obey pam restrictions = yes
  unix password sync = yes
  pam password change = yes
  map to guest = bad user

# Samba Shares

[public]
  comment = Public anonymous access
  path = /mnt/storage/public
  guest ok = yes
  writable = yes
  create mask = 0664
  directory mask = 0775
  force user = nobody

[common]
  comment = Storage area for the few
  path = /mnt/storage/common
  writable = yes
  valid users = @commom
  create mask = 0660
  directory mask = 0770

[homes]
  comment = Home storage area of %S
  path = /mnt/storage/%S
  writable = yes
  valid users = %S
  create mask = 0660
  directory mask = 0770
```
Restart the daemon:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```
